    <div class="alert alert-warning">Please note: These regulations may change as official guidance and policies change.</div>
	<p>President Bresciani’s email from March 4 addressed the new masking guidance from NDSU.  His email reads in part:</p>

	<blockquote class="blockquote text-sm" style="border-left:5px solid #aaaaaa;padding-left:5px;font-size:1rem;"><p>... I know I’m not alone in wanting to move past certain parts of the pandemic, and with Cass County’s COVID Community Level now designated as "low" according to the CDC, their recent guidance nationally, and the counsel of our campus public health experts, I’m happy to announce that effective Monday, March 7, NDSU will no longer require masks in classes. </p>
	 
	<p>Faculty members may choose to continue to require masks in their individual classes, and students will be expected to honor that faculty prerogative.  Of course, every person should feel free to continue wearing a mask and should feel supported in that decision.</p></blockquote>

	<p>Therefore, DPA policy will adhere to the above guidance for our classes and performances, including performers, staff, and audiences.</p>

	<p>Please direct any questions about interpretation of the above policies to the DPA:<br />

	<p>As of August 23, NDSU has set policy that all classroom and related learning spaces carry a mask mandate, with the instructor’s ability to be unmasked for clarity while maintaining appropriate distancing.</p>
	<p>Accordingly, the Division of Performing Arts is adapting these policies to the individual nature of Music and Theatre instruction. These policies apply to all indoor Division of Performing events in our and other facilities, as well as to all outside-sponsored events held in DPA facilities.</p>
	<p>
	Policies:
	<ol>
	<li>All classrooms, teaching studios, and performance spaces in Reineke and Askanase are considered “classrooms.” Masks are therefore required in these spaces, except for optionally unmasked and distanced teacher/presenters. Presenters are defined as the instructor and students assuming the role of presenter or soloistic performer and must maintain distancing from audience and ensemble.</li>
	<li>Faculty offices are “classrooms” when used in teaching situations.  Otherwise, masking is at the discretion of the office’s occupant.</li>
	<li>Ensemble rehearsals, performances, and productions: Performers are masked or modified-masked (instrumental), with distancing at the discretion of ensemble director. Directors and presenters are unmasked at the discretion of the director.</li>
	<li>Audiences: Masking is required. The first several rows shall be unoccupied, the number determined by the director in collaboration with the facilities staff. Reminders about safety protocols will be announced by the director or their designee before beginning performances. The performance will be interrupted if policies are not followed, to be resumed after compliance or cancelled if policies continue to not be followed.</li>
	</ol>
