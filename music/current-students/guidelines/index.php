		<h1>Music Student Recital Guidelines</h1>
	</header>
	
	<article>
		<p>Preparing for your student recital can be a complex, yet exciting task for music  majors. The information below should  guide you  towards a successful recital. <strong>Remember</strong>, <strong>it is up to you to make sure this process moves smoothly</strong>. Do not count on your studio instructor or office staff to make sure you complete  the necessary steps in presenting a recital.</p>
		<p>Prior to your recital you need to complete a successful hearing. Insufficient preparation for the hearing will result in postponing or cancelling the
recital at the discretion of the hearing committee. </p>
		<p><a href="../documents/HandbookExcerptsF19.pdf">See full hearing and jury details here.</a> </p>
		<p><strong>Recital Types</strong></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>MUSC 380 - Preparation and presentation of a half-recital, typically presented in a student's junior year for performance majors, or senior year for music education majors.</li>

          <li>MUSC 480 - Preparation and presentation of a full recital, typically presented in a student's senior year for performance majors.</li>

          <li>MUSC 780 - Preparation and presentation of a professional, full length recital.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Step One</strong></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Register for MUSC 380, 480, or 780 within the first two weeks of the semester. E-permit (available in the office) is necessary for registration.</li>
		</ul>
			
		<p><strong>Step Two: 4 (or more) months prior</strong> </p>
			
		<ul>
			<li> Select recital date and dress rehearsal date. Forms and schedule for Beckwith Recital Hall are available on the School of Music Sharepoint webpage on our <a href="http://bit.ly/PerfArtsSharepoint">CSoM Sharepoint Page</a>. Students must submit all necessary forms for both the dress rehearsal and the recital date. Dates must be approved by instructor and all collaborating musicians. </li>
			
			<li>Dates must be approved by instructor and all collaborating musicians.</li>
			<li>After choosing a date, complete and submit a <a href="https://forms.gle/HTSA3yA7Tn1WACKm9"><strong>Reservation Request Form</strong></a>.</li>
			<li>The date of the recital performance and dress rehearsal should be in the same week.</li>
			<li><strong>The submission of a Reservation Request Form does not guarantee the booking of the requested date and time. An email confirmation will be sent once the Reservation Request Form has been approved and processed. Reservation Requests will be processed on a first come, first served basis.</strong></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Step Three: 1 (or more) months prior</strong></p>
		<li>Schedule the recital hearing and submit the first draft of the recital program, along with translations and program notes (if required) to the applied
teacher.</li>
		<li>Download the <!--<strong><a href="/performingarts/music/current-students/documents/recitals/recital_guidelines-2020.docx">Recital Program Instructions</a> </strong>and--><strong> <a href="../documents/ConcertTemplate.docx">Template</a></strong>.<br>
		  <br>
		</li>
		<strong>The Hearing: </strong>
		<li>The hearing must occur at least two weeks before the recital (one month for vocal).</li>
		<li>The final version of the program and translations/program notes (approved by applied teacher) must be submitted at or before the hearing.		  </li>
		<li>The collaborative pianist (and other collaborators unless excused by the applied instructor) must be present and perform at the hearing.</li>
		<li>Failure to abide by the above will automatically result in postponing or cancelling the recital.</li>
		<li>Insufficient preparation for the hearing will result in postponing or cancelling the recital at the discretion of the hearing committee.		</li>
		
		
		<p><strong>Step Four</strong></p>
			
		<ul>
			<li>Immediately after successful recital hearing: Submit the final recital program <strong>(approved by applied professor and advisor) </strong>to the Director of Promotions.</li>
			<li>Graduate and undergraduate students are responsible for creating their own recital programs. <em>Give yourself ample time to research, develop, and create your program</em>. </li>
			<li>Download the <!--<strong><a href="/performingarts/music/current-students/documents/recitals/recital_guidelines-2020.docx">Recital Program Instructions</a> </strong>and--><strong> <a href="../documents/ConcertTemplate.docx">Template</a></strong>.</li>
			<li>Questions about creating your program? Contact the <a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/performingarts/staff/">Promotions Director </a>for assistance.</li>
			<li>The Challey School of Music will print the program only, not notes and translations. Please use the <a href="../documents/recitals/notes_translations_template.docx"><strong>Notes/Translations Template</strong></a> and bring to Memorial Union Graphic Services, Kinko's, etc for printing.</li>
			
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Step Five: 2 weeks prior</strong></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://forms.gle/KGorjy1B3MZh7QCTA">Submit your programs</a> (all checked and approved by your studio teacher). Program notes and/or translations are submitted through the same form</li>
