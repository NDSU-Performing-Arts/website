 <h1>Voice Performance: Graduate Audition Information and Requirements</h1>
        <div class="alert alert-primary">
        <h2>General Information</h2>

		<p>The NDSU Challey School of Music is accepting applications for graduate degrees in voice performance for the 2024-2025 academic year.</p>

		<p><strong>Live Auditions:</strong> An in-person audition is strongly preferred for all graduate applicants in voice performance. A live audition will be arranged after you have completed the graduate application and successfully passed the pre-screening audition (see Pre-Screening Requirements below). If you are unable to travel to Fargo a live audition, a video audition can be arranged.</p>

		<p><strong>Application Deadline</strong>: The NDSU Graduate School accepts applications for graduate study on a rolling basis throughout the year. However, to be fully considered for an assistantship in music, please submit your completed graduate application and pre-screening recordings by the December 1, 2024 (priority deadline). Assistantship consideration is possible after this date if awards remain available.</p>

		<p><strong>Video Auditions:</strong> In-person auditions are strongly preferred to video auditions. However, the voice faculty will review your application based on video recordings if you cannot travel to Fargo for a live audition. In order to qualify for a video audition, you must submit recordings of all your required audition selections as well as complete an interview via Zoom or a similar platform. Both components are required in order to gain admission to the Challey School of Music. Please <a href="mailto:voice.faculty@ad.ndus.edu?subject=Graduate Audition by Video">contact our voice faculty</a> to discuss this alternative application route and to make arrangements. Refer to the audition repertoire requirements in the yellow box below for the MM and DMA programs.</p>
