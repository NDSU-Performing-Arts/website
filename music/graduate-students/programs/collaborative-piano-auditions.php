 <h1>Collaborative Piano Audition Information and Requirements</h1>
        
        NDSU Collaborative Piano auditions will be held on Saturday, February 25, 2017 in Beckwith Recital Hall at NDSU. Instrumental and vocal partners will be provided for collaborative piano auditions. If you wish to bring your own partner, that is  acceptable. </span>Alternate audition dates are sometimes possible: please&nbsp;contact <a href="mailto:tyler.wottrich@ndsu.edu">Dr. Tyler Wottrich</a> if you wish to audition in person and are unavailable on February 25, 2017. Videorecorded auditions are also accepted, but a live audition is recommended for strongest consideration.</p>
        <p>There is no official deadline for application to the NDSU Graduate School; however, since we will be unable to schedule your audition until you are officially accepted into the NDSU Graduate School, we recommend applying to the Graduate School as soon as possible.</span></p>
