            <!--<div class="alert alert-info"><p><strong>Updated Covid policy:</strong><br />
            Effective March 7, NDSU lifted the mask requirement. The Music Academy will follow the same guidelines as NDSU. NDSU policies state that the instructor may choose to continue to require masks in their individual classes and students will be expected to honor that faculty prerogative. Every person should feel free to continue wearing a mask and should feel supported in that decision. <br />
            Check with your instructor to find out their preference for mask or no mask. </p>

            <p>I will continue to update parents, students, and instructors if policies change throughout the semester.</p></div>-->

Once a student registers for lessons, I email that Spreadsheet link to the student. The student then edits the document to pick a lesson time that works for them. </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are the tuition amounts different for fall versus spring versus summer?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> The tuition changes because there are a different amount of lessons. In the fall there are 13 lessons, in the spring there are 15 lessons, and in the summer there are 8 lessons. </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where do the lessons take place?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Peace Lutheran Church. The address is 1011 12th Ave. N, Fargo. Upon entering the church, walk towards the back. There will be a host to greet you and direct you to where lessons are. The lesson rooms are located upstairs in the Sunday School wing of the church. </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are instruments provided by the Academy?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> No, students will need to purchase or rent their own instruments. Of course, we do have pianos at the church for lessons! For other instruments, check out local music stores such as Eckroth Music and Schmitt Music for purchasing or rental options. </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> What materials should be purchased for lessons?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Besides an instrument, lesson materials will be determined by your instructor specifically for you! At the first lesson, the instructor will get to know the student’s level to recommend appropriate method books and music. These materials can often be purchased at Eckroth Music, Schmitt Music, or Popplers Music. </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> What length of lessons should I select for my child?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> This depends on the age, attention span, and goals of the student. For younger students age 4-12, I would recommend 30 minutes. Middle school and high school levels would be more 45 minutes to an hour. If your child is interested in being involved in music at the college level, I would say definitely an hour. </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I sign my child up for lessons on multiple instruments?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> You sure can! </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> What days and times are lessons available?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Academy hours are Monday through Friday, 4:00pm-8:00pm. However, each instructor has different availability within that time frame. Once you register for lessons, I will send you a Google Spreadsheet of the instructor’s availability. </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why aren’t there lessons during the weekend?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Our instructors are all music majors at NDSU. They often have musical obligations and performances on the weekend. </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can we invite friends and family to the recital?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Yes, of course!  </p>
