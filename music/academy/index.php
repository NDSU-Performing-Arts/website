			<p>We are excited to continue another year of music-making at the NDSU Music Academy! Spring lessons will be offered both in-person and virtually.</p>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info"><p><strong>Updated Covid policy:</strong><br />
            Effective March 7, NDSU lifted the mask requirement. The Music Academy will follow the same guidelines as NDSU. NDSU policies state that the instructor may choose to continue to require masks in their individual classes and students will be expected to honor that faculty prerogative. Every person should feel free to continue wearing a mask and should feel supported in that decision. <br />
            Check with your instructor to find out their preference for mask or no mask. </p>

            <p>I will continue to update parents, students, and instructors if policies change throughout the semester.</p></div>

			<p>We feel our Music Academy is a great opportunity to enrich our community by educating students young and old about music and the fine arts. Please contact us for more information about lesson availability or other questions you may have concerning the Academy. We look forward to meeting you!</p>

			<h2>Registration</h2>

			<p>There is a $20 registration fee per student for first time registration only</p> 

			<p>After registering, we will contact you to schedule your weekly lesson time. Once we have found a time that works for your lesson, please pay your new student registration fee of $20 online through our website within 48 hours. When we have received your new student fee, we will reserve your lesson time. If the new student fee is not received within 48 hours, the lesson time that was agreed upon will become available for other students to reserve.</p>

			<p><strong>Payments</strong></p>

			<p>Once you have registered, you may pay in full or make two payments per semester for the fall and spring semesters. Payment is due before the first lesson. Lessons will not begin until payment has been received. If paying twice per semester, the second payment is due during the seventh week of the semester. Summer session payment is due in full before the first lesson. Payment can be made in the form of a check or credit card. Checks should be made out to NDSU and sent to:
			<br />
			NDSU Music Academy<br />
			Attn: Tracey Dahl <br />
			PO Box 6050 Dept 2330<br />
			Fargo ND 58108<br /><br />
			
			<a href="https://northdakotastate-ndus.nbsstore.net/music-academy-payment" class="btn btn-ndsu-green btn-lg">Pay Lessons Online</a>
			<Br /><br />
			This site will ask for the contribution amount. You’ll need to type in the tuition amount since it changes by semester. In the fall semester there are 15 lessons, and in the spring semester there are 13 lessons. Therefore, the tuition amount changes. 
			</p>

			<p><strong>Make-up lessons</strong></p>

			<p>There will be the option of making up one lesson each semester for an excused absence. An absence will be counted as excused when the teacher is notified at least one week prior to the missed lesson. If a student is ill, the teacher must be notified by phone a minimum of two hours prior to the lesson. If the teacher was not notified prior to the absence, the lesson will be counted as unexcused and will not be rescheduled. All make up lessons will take place during normal Academy hours.</p>

			<p><strong>Expectations </strong></p>

			<p>Academy students are expected to:</p>

			<ol>
			<li>keep a regular practice schedule as specified by their instructor</li>
			<li>attend all lessons and recital in which they are enrolled</li>
			<li>bring instrument, music and all lesson materials to each lesson</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p><strong>Building Policies</strong></p>

			<p>Peace Lutheran Church has graciously opened their facility for Academy use, we wish to keep their building in good order and respect their property. The Sunday school wing is the only place students and parents will be allowed to wait in the building. An adult must accompany students at all times. Students may not wait outside of the building for any reason and must remain in the Sunday school wing. Our building host will greet you at the door and escort you to the Sunday school wing. Please use the west door located by the parking lot.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Student Dismissal</strong></p>

			<p>Students who are not meeting the expectations listed above may be dismissed at any time with tuition forfeited.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Cancellation of lessons</strong></p>

			<p>Lesson cancelled by the instructor will be made up at the earliest convenience of both parties. The Music Academy will only cancel lessons due to bad weather if NDSU cancels events for that day. Check the NDSU website, <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu">www.ndsu.edu</a>, for cancellation information. We will not follow public school or Peace Lutheran cancellations. If a student decides to cancel due to bad weather and NDSU is open, the instructor is not obligated to make up the absence. I will send out an email blast and post on the NDSU Music Academy Facebook page when lessons are canceled.</p>

			<p>Withdrawing from lessons requires written notification to the Academy office. If written notification is not received, students will still be considered officially enrolled and charged accordingly for tuition.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>

			<p>After the first payment has been received, students are obligated to pay for that half of the semester. If a student has paid in full for the semester and does not continue lessons in the second half of the semester, a refund will be given for the second half of the semester.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Late Arrival</strong></p>

			<p>Students are expected to arrive on time and be ready for their lesson to begin at the specified time. Instructors will wait 15 minutes before assuming the student will be absent for the lesson. Instructors are not required to make up for lost time. However, if an instructor is late they will arrange to make up the lost time.</p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> How are lessons set up?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Before the semester begins, I collect all the instructors’ availability. I create a Google Spreadsheet for each instructor with times they are available to teach. Once a student registers for lessons, I email that Spreadsheet link to the student. The student then edits the document to pick a lesson time that works for them. </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are the tuition amounts different for fall versus spring versus summer?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> The tuition changes because there are a different amount of lessons. In the fall there are 13 lessons, in the spring there are 15 lessons, and in the summer there are 8 lessons.  </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where do the lessons take place?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Peace Lutheran Church. The address is 1011 12th Ave. N, Fargo. Upon entering the church, walk towards the back. There will be a host to greet you and direct you to where lessons are. The lesson rooms are located upstairs in the Sunday School wing of the church.  </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are instruments provided by the Academy?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> No, students will need to purchase or rent their own instruments. Of course, we do have pianos at the church for lessons! For other instruments, check out local music stores such as Eckroth Music and Schmitt Music for purchasing or rental options.  </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> What materials should be purchased for lessons?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Besides an instrument, lesson materials will be determined by your instructor specifically for you! At the first lesson, the instructor will get to know the student’s level to recommend appropriate method books and music. These materials can often be purchased at Eckroth Music, Schmitt Music, or Popplers Music.  </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> What length of lessons should I select for my child?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> This depends on the age, attention span, and goals of the student. For younger students age 4-12, I would recommend 30 minutes. Middle school and high school levels would be more 45 minutes to an hour. If your child is interested in being involved in music at the college level, I would say definitely an hour.   </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I sign my child up for lessons on multiple instruments?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> You sure can! </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> What days and times are lessons available?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Academy hours are Monday through Friday, 3:30-8:00pm. However, each instructor has different availability within that time frame. Once you register for lessons, I will send you a Google Spreadsheet of the instructor’s availability.  </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why aren’t there lessons during the weekend?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Our instructors are all music majors at NDSU. They often have musical obligations and performances on the weekend. </p>

				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can we invite friends and family to the recital?<br />
				<strong>A:</strong> Yes, of course!  </p>
