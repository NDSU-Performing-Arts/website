		<p>Originally from Holland, Michigan, Martin J. Van Klompenberg currently teaches bassoon and chamber music at the Challey School of Music at North Dakota State University.  From 2013 – 2022, he served as a member of the United States Army Band program, performing with the 101st Airborne Division “Air Assault” Band (Fort Campbell, KY), the 282nd Army Band (Fort Jackson, SC), the 323rd Army Band “Fort Sam’s Own” (Fort Sam Houston/San Antonio, TX) and the Air Force Band of the West (San Antonio, TX). Prior to joining the ranks of military musicians, he attended the University of Arizona, where he obtained the Doctorate of Musical Arts degree, studying with William Dietz. He also earned degrees from Arizona State University and Western Michigan University, studying with Albie Micklich and Wendy Rose, respectively. He has also studied composition with award-winning composer Jenni Brandon.</p>

		<p>A proponent of new music, Martin is active in commissioning projects for new works for bassoon, commissioning and premiering new works by Jamie Leigh Sampson, Lisa Neher, Rob McClure, Shao Fern Teo, Dylan Findley, and Brain Bunker. He has been fortunate to perform at conferences for the International Double Reed Society, the International Clarinet Association, the National Flute Association, the College Music Society, and the Texas Music Education Association, among others. He has also presented solo and chamber recitals throughout the United States.</p>

		<p>As a composer, his works have been performed by artists such as the Heartland Marimba Ensemble, the University of Georgia Contemporary Ensemble, Scott Pool (Bassoon – Texas A&M at Corpus Christi), Valerie Cowan (The United States Army Fife and Drum Corps), and Erin Webber (Oboe – The University of Texas at San Antonio), and at venues such as the National Flute Association annual convention, the International Clarinet Association ClarinetFest, Mid-Atlantic Flute Convention, Vox Novus and the Tutti New Music Festival. In 2023, he was chosen as a winner of the International Double Reed Society Commissioning Competition. His work, 3 Travelers for solo bassoon, was premiered by bassoonist Kunatorn Teekakul at their 2023 Annual Conference in Thailand.</p>

		<p>When not playing bassoon, Martin enjoys spending time with his wife, Abbie, (Assistant Professor of Music Education, Concordia College, Moorhead, MN), and his two rescue dogs, Sirius and Luna, visiting America’s zoos and supporting the Chicago Cubs.</p>
