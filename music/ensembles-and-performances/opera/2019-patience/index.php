		<h1>Gilbert & Sullivan's Patience</h1>
	</header>
	
	<article>
		<p><em>Patience </em> is a pointed satire of the Aesthetic Movement, which flourished in mid-19th century England and United States.  “Art for Art’s Sake” was its followers' motto. More than 135 years since its premiere, today’s audience will still relate to this brilliant parody of art and to the meaning of love.  </p>
		
		<p>In the operetta, all the upper-class young ladies in the village, rapturously caught up in aestheticism, have conceived an affection for two aesthetic poets — a "fleshly" poet and an "idyllic" poet. But the poets are both in love with Patience, the simple village milkmaid, who cares nothing for poetry or art. Patience learns from the ladies that true love must be completely unselfish--it must “wither and sting and burn!” The girls' Dragoon Guard ex-boyfriends don't see the point to aesthetics, but they are willing to attempt their own “transfiguration” into devoted followers to win them back.</p>
