		<p> We are pleased to present to you a LIVE performance of opera scenes from various Broadway Musicals including Oklahoma, Annie Get Your Gun, Little Women, and more! This special performance will take place outside, weather permitting and availble to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqtD6NMzplHIhHFY-MvfRtQ">live stream</a>. Ticket reservation is required for the in-person performance, requests for seating reservations will be accepted via a Google Form. Your ticket will be confirmed via email after you submit a request. Guests must provide their own seating arrangement and seating will begin at 3:30 PM.     <br>

		  <strong>Weather Contingency Plan:</strong> In the case of inclement weather our in-person performance will be cancelled and pivoted to a streaming only performance. Ticket holders will be notified by <strong>Thursday, May 6 at 2:00 PM</strong> (please plan on checking your email). The performance will be available for streaming. Seating will be by reservation ONLY. For health and safety reasons, no walk-up admission will be possible. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we will be able to grant all requests received due to limited, socially-distanced seating, so it is recommended to submit your reservation requests as early as possible. More information for concert-goers will be provided to those with confirmed seating reservations.<br>
