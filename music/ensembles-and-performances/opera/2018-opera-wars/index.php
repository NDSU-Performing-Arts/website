		<p>Mozart’s <em>The Impresario</em> (1786) features the comedic trials and tribulations of two warring sopranos fighting for the lead role in the impresario’s new opera production. A comedic Singspiel, this musical drama has spoken dialogue as well as sung arias and ensembles and will be performed in English. </p>

		<p>Another type of “Opera War” will be presented in Maurice Ravel’s <em>L'Enfant et les Sortileges (The Child and the Enchantments)</em>. In the original libretto by Colette, written around 1917, a naughty little boy throws a tantrum and the animals and inanimate objects that he has harmed or broken in the past come to life to confront him. The NDSU production will draw upon parallels between the story of the opera and Ravel’s actual experiences during WWI, when he served in the French Army. The child represents Ravel himself, confronted by his traumatizing memories of the War.  Musical highlights include the beautiful final chorus which stands as a tribute to the innate compassion embodied in a human soul.</p>
