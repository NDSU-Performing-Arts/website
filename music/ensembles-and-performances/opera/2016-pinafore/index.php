        <p>NDSU Performing Arts Box Office: 701.231.7969</p>
		
        <p>NDSU Opera presents Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic operetta HMS Pinafore on Friday, May 6 at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday, May 8 at 2:00 p.m. Both performances are at Festival Concert Hall located in NDSU’s Reineke Fine Arts Center, 12th Avenue North and Bolley Drive.</p>
		
		<p>The absurdity of class distinctions, love triumphant against the odds, babies switched in infancy, a modicum of swashbuckling, and plenty of rousing choruses make HMS Pinafore a perennial favorite with audiences.</p>
		
		<p>W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan's theatrical partnership was as successful as any seen later on Broadway. In all, the pair composed 14 operettas, many of which remain popular today. Their fourth collaboration, <em>HMS Pinafore</em>, or the <em>Lass that Loved a Sailor</em>, was their first international success. It opened in London in 1878 and ran for almost 600 performances. With it, the musical team perfected the formula that would lead to ever-greater popularity in works such as <em>Pirates of Penzance and Mikado.</em></p>
