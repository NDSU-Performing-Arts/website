		<p>The NDSU Concert Choir has a distinguished tradition of performing eminent choral literature at the highest level of artistry. Under Jo Ann Miller's direction, the choir has performed at state, regional and national music conferences--including eight North Central American Choral Directors Association conferences and the association's national conference in San Antonio, Texas. The choir performs regularly with the Fargo Moorhead Symphony and tours overseas every three years. Most recently, the choir visited Eastern and Central Europe in 2009, toured Croatia and Italy in 2012, and Iceland and Scotland in 2015. The choir received the first place gold medal at the International Choral Competition in Zadar, Croatia, during the 2012 tour. </p>
		
		<p>The choir has performed such masterworks as Vaughan William's <i>Sea Symphony</i>, Mendelssohn's <i>Elijah</i>, Beethoven's <i>Ninth Symphony</i>, Verdi's<i> Requiem, Carmina Burana</i> by Carl Orff, the <i>War Requiem</i> of Benjamin Britten, and <i>Belshazzar's Feast</i> by William Walton, to name but a few pieces. The repertoire of the choir is solidly traditional. Because of the touring the choir does, most of the repertoire is unaccompanied, a mix of sacred and secular and including all style periods. For their European tours, the programs showcase American composers of art music as well as the the rich folk song traditions of America.</p>
		
		<p>Choir members are from many majors at NDSU, though more than two-thirds are music majors. The 60+ voice choir rehearses daily and performs several concerts each year on campus and during annual spring tours. The choir has produced more than 30 recordings.</p>

The auditions consist of vocalizing to determine range and voice type, pitch and melody matching, some sight reading and a prepared piece, if possible. An accompanist is provided. The audition usually takes between 15 and 30 minutes.</p>
