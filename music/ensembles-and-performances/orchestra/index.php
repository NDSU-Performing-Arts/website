		<h3>SCE</h3>
		<p><strong>MUSC 316 0-1 Rehearsals <u>6:30-8:00pm Thursday Night</u></strong></p>
		<p>There will be one excerpt chosen by the player. This excerpt should demonstrate the skill level of the player and can be either lyrical or technical. Excerpt should be @ 2 minutes maximum in length. Aspiring ensemble members need to have string playing experience – but this ensemble will be less rigorous than the USO and will emphasize and promote playing development and improvement through quality string orchestra literature. </p>

		<p><strong>If you are successful and selected to be in the USO - you can also be and are encouraged to be in the SCE too. In other words - you can be in both ensembles. </strong></p>
