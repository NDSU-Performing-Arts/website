			<h3>2021 NDSU Chamber Music Festival<br />
		  Thursday, August 26 - Tuesday, August 31, 2021</h3><br />
		
		  <br />
			<h4>Concerts in Beckwith Recital Hall</h4>
			Thursday, August 26 at 7:30 pm<br>
			Monday, August 30 at 7:30 pm<br>
			Tuesday, August 31 at 7:30 pm<br>


			<p>Come join us as we once again celebrate the joy of great chamber music together in person! Though we were able to also enjoy chamber music together outside in the Reineke courtyard for the Special 2020 edition of the NDSU Chamber Music Festival, we are pleased to announce a return to Beckwith Recital Hall with its superb chamber music acoustics for our 2021 Festival August 26-31.</p>
			
			<p>We are thrilled to announce the extraordinary special guest artists for our 2021 Festival: the <strong>Grammy-Award winning Attacca String Quartet</strong>, as well as <strong>Gabriel Campos-Zamora</strong>, <strong>Principal Clarinet of the Minnesota Orchestra</strong>. These world-class artists will be rehearsing with our NDSU student pianists during the Festival to prepare a varied selection of chamber masterworks of Beethoven, Brahms, Dvorak, Mendelssohn, Poulenc, and Schumann for your listening pleasure on the August 30 and 31 concerts!</p>
			
			<p><!--Beckwith Recital Hall will be operating at full capacity, and masks will be optional.-->Previously, it had been advertised that masks would be optional for the Festival concerts; however, due to the rise in COVID cases related to the Delta variant, NDSU recently amended their policy to require masks for individuals in classroom spaces, which include performances spaces like Beckwith Recital Hall. <strong>Therefore, masks will be required regardless of vaccination status for all individuals in order to be able to attend any of the NDSU Chamber Music Festival events.</strong> It is also recommended that audience members exercise judiciousness in spacing themselves in Beckwith Recital Hall for the concerts.<!--Fall 2021 safety procedures and guidelines have not yet been finalized for NDSU's performing arts spaces, so please stay tuned for more information about our safety procedures and guidelines for the Festival.--><br><br>

			We hope you will join us as we come together for the 2021 NDSU Chamber Music Festival!</p>
