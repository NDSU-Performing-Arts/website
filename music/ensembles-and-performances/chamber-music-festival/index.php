	Since 2015, the NDSU Chamber Music Festival has paired NDSU student musicians with professional musicians including NDSU faculty as well as local, national, and international luminaries in performances of chamber music presented free of charge to the NDSU and Fargo-Moorhead community. Guest musicians at the Festival have included Grammy Award-winning artists, faculty from such institutions as the Royal Academy of Music in London and Carnegie Mellon, and players from many of the major U.S. orchestras. A wide diversity of great composers has been represented in the Festival's programming, from the likes of Mozart and Beethoven to more recent greats such as Margaret Bonds, Frank Zappa, and Libby Larsen, some of whose work has had its World Premiere in Fargo at the Festival. Chamber music, being music for small groups of musicians performing without a conductor, is unique in its combination of potent immediacy and enormous dramatic range. We are proud to be able to share performances by NDSU students and professional musicians of this wonderful music.
