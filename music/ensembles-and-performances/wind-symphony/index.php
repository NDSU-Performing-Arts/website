	<p>The North Dakota State University Wind Symphony is the premier collegiate wind band performing group in the state of North Dakota. Students who participate experience the highest quality of music literature. Comprised of both Music Majors and Non-Majors, the members of the NDSU Wind Symphony come from a wide array of backgrounds and disciplines. Under the direction of Dr. Warren Olfert, students work tirelessly from practice room to the concert hall to create musical artistry for audiences across the Midwest and the Nation. Now they would like to bring that high level of excellence to the other side of the world.</p>

 

	<p>In the Fall of 2017 on campus, the NDSU Wind Symphony had the opportunity to work with Colonel Václav Blahunek, conductor of the Prague Castle Guard and Czech Symphonic Police Band. It was through this experience, and the impression made upon Col. Blahunek, that the NDSU Wind Symphony received an invitation from The Ministry of Culture for the Czech Republic to perform with the Czech Police Symphonic Police Band in the Spanish Hall in the New Royal Palace of Prague Castle.
		
	<p>The NDSU Wind Symphony, led by Professor Warren Olfert, embarked on a tour of Eastern Europe, visiting and performing in Budai Vigadó (Hungarian Heritage House) in Budapest, the Slovak Radio Hall in Bratislava, and culminating with a prestigious performance in the Spanish Hall in the Prague Castle to a sold-out audience of over 600 dignitaries. The group was the first American ensemble to ever perform in the Spanish Hall. Over 65 students, faculty, chaperones, and alumni participated in this once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
