		<p>A native Fargoan, Robert is the son of the late Clyde and Myrtle Challey, both NDSU graduates. Myrtle Challey taught Food and Nutrition at NDSU during the 1960s. Robert's uncle was Bill Euren, director of the NDSU Gold Star Band from 1948-1968. Robert, Sheila, and their three children live in Danville and Lake Tahoe, California. He is chairman of the board of The Park Place Group, a real estate development and investment company in Walnut Creek, California.</p>
		
		<p>Robert graduated from NDSU in 1967, where he participated in the Gold Star Band as a drum major and trombonist. He was vice president of the student body, a student senator, a member of Blue Key Honor Society, and a producer of the musical Oklahoma.</p>
		
		<p>In 1981 Robert was elected to the NDSU Development Foundation Board of Trustees and in that capacity has served on numerous committees and advisory boards. He also serves as a director and treasurer for the Smuin Ballet of San Francisco and was instrumental in two Smuin Ballet performances in Fargo.
