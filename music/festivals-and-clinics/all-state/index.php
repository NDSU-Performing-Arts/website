		The clinic will consist of individual sessions for each instrument, full group sessions discussing general practice techniques and recording preparation, and optional individual meetings with NDSU faculty. Individual sessions will include tips for each element of the audition (major and chromatic scales, etude), followed by optional mock auditions, in which you can perform your audition for your clinician for feedback. Alternatively, you can send a recording to your clinician for feedback.</p>
		
        </p><p>Pre-registration is required so that we can send out the appropriate zoom links to each student/teacher in attendance.
