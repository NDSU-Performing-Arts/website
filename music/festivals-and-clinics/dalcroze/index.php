		<h3>COURSE DESCRIPTION:</h3>	
		<p>This course will provide a foundation of Dalcroze Eurhythmics and demonstrate how a purposeful movement approach can be woven into many musical curriculums. Students will have the opportunity to internalize the elements of music through the four facets of eurhythmics: movement, rhythmic solfège, keyboard improvisation and plastique animée. Lessons and pedagogy will occur throughout the week with opportunities for participants to create micro-lessons to present on the final day.  </p>

			<ul>
			<li>Be actively engaged in the components of Dalcroze eurhythmics, solfege, and piano improvisation.</li>
