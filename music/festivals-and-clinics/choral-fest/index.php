		<p>We are pleased to invite you to the 32nd Annual NDSU High School Choral Festival on <b>Sunday, October 3 </b>and <b>Monday, October 4, 2021</b>.  We look forward to this opportunity to work with your students and host you on our campus.</p>
 
		<p>The festival’s <b>registration will begin at 1:15 p.m.</b> on Sunday, October 3 and will be followed by a concert featuring the NDSU Concert Choir and Madrigal Singers 2 p.m. Masks will be required for the concert and all rehearsals. Rehearsals will begin after the concert.  The <b>Choral Festival Concert is scheduled for Monday, October 4 at 4:30 p.m.</b> Admission to both concerts is free.</p>
 
		<p>We are excited to offer the following choirs for your students. The Tenor/Bass choir for 9th and 10th grade students will be conducted by Michael Weber; the Soprano/Alto choir for 9th and 10th grade students will be conducted by Charlette Moe.  The auditioned Chamber Choir for students in grades 11 & 12 will  be conducted by Jo Ann Miller.  The mixed choir for 11th and 12th grade students will be conducted by Dr. Jon Nero.  Dr. Nero is the Director of Choral Activities at Black Hills State University in Spearfish, SD.   He is also the Artistic Director of the Dakota Choral Union in Rapid City, SD.  He has taught at the elementary, secondary, and university levels in North Dakota and Minnesota. Dr. Nero is also an active singer and guest conductor in South Dakota, Wyoming, and North Dakota.</p> 
 
		<p>Auditions for the NDSU High School Chamber Choir will be submitted online during the first week of school in the fall with a <strong>due date of September 13, 2021</strong>.  Each student will submit an electronic file with the student singing a folksong or an art song – no Broadway or pop music.  Students should identify which part they are auditioning for, i.e. soprano or alto.  The size of the NDSU High School Chamber Honor Choir will be 24 – 32 voices. We will announce the selected singers on September 16, 2021.  </p>  

		<p><b>All students</b> will be expected to have their music learned prior to the festival so they can create a true musical experience and enjoy creating music with their peers.  It will be the student’s responsibility to get the music and learn it before the first rehearsal.  Links for rehearsal tracks will be sent next week.</p>

		<p>For the other festival choirs, each school may send one SATB quartet to the Mixed Choir and a balanced trio to the Soprano/Alto Choir and a balanced trio to the Tenor/Bass Choir.  If you have any questions about participation, please do not hesitate to contact any of us.  <strong>Due to safety concerns, the size of the choirs will be restricted and they will sing masked.</strong>   We will take registrations on a first-come basis.  <strong>The registration fee for each student is $45,</strong> which includes a t-shirt, supper on Sunday night, and lunch on Monday.  Choral directors will be the guests of the NDSU Challey School of Music. </p>
		
		<p><a href="https://forms.gle/rss5JYJtN277nz1B7" class="btn btn-warning">Online Registration</a></p>
		
		<p><b>Please send a certificate of liability insurance from your school.  You only need to send one per district.  </b></p>

		<p><b>Registrations are due by Wednesday, September 22, 2021.</b></p>

		
		<p>We have the philosophy that the directors should choose the students who will best represent their school at the Choral Festival.  To create the most successful experience and to be fair to all participants, please do not select singers who are so inexperienced that they cannot sing their part independently. We know that you will take this request in the spirit in which it is intended.  Thank you.</p>
