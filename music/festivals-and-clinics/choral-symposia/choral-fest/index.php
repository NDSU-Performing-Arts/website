	    </p>
		<p>We are pleased to invite you to the 31st  Annual NDSU High School Choral Festival on <b>Sunday, October 6 </b>and <b>Monday, October 7, 2019</b>.  We look forward to this opportunity to work with your students and host you on our campus.</p>
 
		<p>The festival’s <b>registration will begin at 1:15 p.m.</b> on Sunday, October 6 and will be followed by a concert featuring the NDSU Concert Choir and Madrigal Singers 2 p.m.  Rehearsals will begin after the concert.  The <b>Choral Festival Concert is scheduled for Monday, October 7 at 4:30 p.m.</b> Admission to both concerts is free.</p>
 
		<p>We are excited to offer the following choirs for your students. The men’s choir for 9th and 10th grade men will be conducted by Dr. Michael Weber; the women’s choir for 9th and 10th grade women will be conducted by Dr. Charlette Moe.  This year, the guest conductor for the mixed 11th & 12th grade mixed choir will be Allan Petker.  Mr. Petker conducts several choirs in California and is the Vice President of Publications for the Fred Bock Music Company and the owner of Pavane Publishing.  He is also a professional composer and conductor.  The auditioned Chamber Choir for students in grades 11 & 12 will again be conducted by Dr. Jo Ann Miller.  </p> 
 
		<p>Auditions for the NDSU High School Chamber Choir will be submitted online during the first week of school in the fall with a <b>due date of September 10, 2019</b>. Each student will submit an electronic file with the student singing a folksong or an art song – no Broadway or pop music. The size of the NDSU High School Chamber Honor Choir will be 24 – 32 voices. We will announce the selected singers on September 13, 2019.  Please listen to the files before you send them.  We have had files submitted that were almost inaudible and to the detriment of the student.</p>  

		<p><b>All students</b>will be expected to have their music learned prior to the festival so they can create a true musical experience and enjoy creating music with their peers. It will be the student’s responsibility to get the music and learn it before the first rehearsal. </p>

		<p>For the other festival choirs, each school may send one SATB quartet to the Mixed Choir and a balanced trio to the Women’s Choir and a balanced trio to the Men’s Choir. If you have any questions about participation, please do not hesitate to contact any of us. <b>The registration fee for each student is $45</b>, which includes a t-shirt, supper on Sunday night, and lunch on Monday. Choral directors will be the guests of the NDSU Challey School of Music. </p>
		
		<p><b>From each school we need  registration filled out and  a  certificate of insurance. Registrations are due by Wednesday, September 25, 2019</b></p>

		<p>We have the philosophy that the directors should choose the students who will best represent their school at the Choral Festival.  To create the most successful experience and to be fair to all participants, please do not select singers who are so inexperienced that they cannot sing their part independently. We know that you will take this request in the spirit in which it is intended.  Thank you.</p>
