		<h2>2020 First Prize: Ian Shaw</h2>
		
		<p><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Where Is This Stupendous Stranger</em></p>
		
		<p><p>Ian Shaw is honoured and delighted to be a winner of the Edwin Fissinger Composition Prize. Born in England in 1960, he studied at Cambridge University, where he was an Organ Student of St John’s College and a John Stewart of Rannoch Scholar in Sacred Music, at the Sweelinck Conservatorium of Amsterdam and, in a recent sabbatical year, at Goldsmith’s College London, where his research interests included the development of Black theatre in the United Kingdom and the value of stand-up comedy in prisons. <br>
					<br>
				  
        A first-study organist, his teachers included Peter Hurford, John Scott and Piet Kee. He was for nine years Sub-Organist at Durham Cathedral but for the last three decades has mainly worked outside church music as a conductor or pianist, in disciplines including ballet, music theatre and opera. He has a particular interest in new work, and has been involved in world premières of operas by, for example, Philip Glass at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden; Stuart MacRae, Lliam Paterson and others at Scottish Opera; Michael Ellison in Istanbul and Dominique Le Gendre in Trinidad. <br>
        <br>
				  
        He is a somewhat reticent composer. <i>Where is this Stupendous Stranger? </i>– dedicated to the Latvian flautist Alisa Klimanska – is typical of many small‐scale choral pieces. Larger works include <i>Service of the Sacrament</i> (a companion to Buxtehude’s Missa Brevis), an organ symphony <i>The Temptation of Christ</i>, an orchestral song cycle <i>A Breath of Nothing</i> (to the Orpheus Sonnets of Rilke) and incidental music for stage productions of <i>Othello</i> and <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream.</i>
