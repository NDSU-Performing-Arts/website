		<h1>Edwin Fissinger Choral Composition Prize</h1>
	</header>
	<p>NDSU Challey School of Music honors the legacy and traditions of noted choral composer and long-time NDSU choral conductor Edwin Fissinger with its annual choral composition competition.</p>
	
	<!--<div class="alert alert-warning">We apologize for the delay in announcing the winners of the 2022 Fissinger Composition Prize.  We judges are working hard to come to a decision – it’s a good thing to have so many fine entries this year (almost 200) that we have to spend more time discussing and listening.  Soon we will announce!</div>-->
	
	<h2>Winners</h2>
	<h3>Professional Composer Division</h3>
	<?php biobox("images/Clark Lawlor-217_2x3.jpg","<p><strong>Clark William Lawlor<br />
	The World's Wanderers</strong></p><p>Clark William Lawlor (b. 1980) is a software engineer and award-winning choral composer based in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. His recent accolades include First Prize in the 2023 International Contest of Choral Composition University of Alcala (Spain); First Prize in the 2023 Utah ACDA Choral Composing Competition; and finalist in the 2023 Ensemble Altera Composition Competition.</p>
	<p>Despite his recent successes, Clark is somewhat of a newcomer to the choral composing scene. Although he studied music at the University of Utah in the early 2000s, Clark dropped out before earning a degree to pursue a more “responsible” career. With the pressures of attending business school, building a career, and supporting a growing family, Clark took a long hiatus from music. He had all but lost his dream of a music career until 2022 when, after over 15 years away, Clark decided to join a local choir, and shortly thereafter began composing choral music again.</p>
	<p>His first work, a setting of the Swedish text “I denna ljuva sommartid,” has seen surprising success on YouTube and in sheet music sales. In the past year, Clark has written over a dozen choral compositions, and has been the recipient of multiple awards. He recently signed on with a promising new publisher, Endeavor Music (https://www.endeavormusicpublishing.com/) and is excited to be a part of their growth.</p>
	<p>In addition to writing music, Clark enjoys cycling, pickleball, and spending time with his wife and 5 children.</p>");?>
