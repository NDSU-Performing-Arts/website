		<h1>Edwin Fissinger Choral Composition Prize</h1>

	<p>NDSU Challey School of Music honors the legacy and traditions of noted choral composer and long-time NDSU choral conductor Edwin Fissinger with its annual choral composition competition.</p>
	
	<!--<div class="alert alert-warning">We apologize for the delay in announcing the winners of the 2022 Fissinger Composition Prize.  We judges are working hard to come to a decision – it’s a good thing to have so many fine entries this year (almost 200) that we have to spend more time discussing and listening.  Soon we will announce!</div>-->
