				<h1>Joshua Fishbein </h1>
				<p>Dr. Joshua Fishbein composes and arranges vocal and instrumental music, with special emphasis on choral music. He has won awards from the American Choral Directors Association, the American Composers Forum, BMI, the Cantate Chamber Singers, Chorus America, Chorus Austin, The Esoterics, the Guild of Temple Musicians, the National Lutheran Choir, and several other music organizations. Professional vocal ensembles, such as Cantus, Chicago <em>a cappella</em>, The Thirteen, Volti, and Washington Master Chorale, have premiered Fishbein’s original music. Steeped in Jewish music, he has composed numerous Jewish and interfaith compositions for chorus and solo voice. Currently, Dr. Fishbein is an adjunct faculty member of The Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University. Previously, he taught at Towson University, The College of New Jersey, the University of Maryland Baltimore County, and the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Fishbein holds degrees in music from the University of California Los Angeles, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and Carnegie Mellon University. E.C. Schirmer Music Company, Hal Leonard Corporation, Transcontinental Music Publications, Abundant Silence, and Yelton Rhodes Music publish his compositions.</p>

				<p>Ian Shaw is honoured and delighted to be a winner of the Edwin Fissinger Composition Prize. 
				  Born in England in 1960, he studied at Cambridge University, where he was an Organ Student of St John’s College and a John Stewart of Rannoch Scholar in Sacred Music, at the Sweelinck Conservatorium of Amsterdam and, in a recent sabbatical year, at Goldsmith’s College London, where his research interests included the development of Black theatre in the United Kingdom and the value of stand-up comedy in prisons. <br>
					<br>
				  
				  A first‐study organist, his teachers included Peter Hurford, John Scott and Piet Kee. He was for nine years Sub-‐Organist at Durham Cathedral but for the last three decades has mainly worked outside church music as a conductor or pianist, in disciplines including ballet, music theatre and opera. He has a particular interest in new work, and has been involved in world premières of operas by, for example, Philip Glass at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden; Stuart MacRae, Lliam Paterson and others at Scottish Opera; Michael Ellison in Istanbul and Dominique Le Gendre in Trinidad. <br>
				  <br>
				  
				  He is a somewhat reticent composer. <i>Where is this Stupendous Stranger? </i>– dedicated to the Latvian flautist Alisa Klimanska – is typical of many small‐scale choral pieces. Larger works include <i>Service of the Sacrament</i> (a companion to Buxtehude’s Missa Brevis), an organ symphony <i>The Temptation of Christ</i>, an orchestral song‐cycle <i>A Breath of Nothing</i> (to the Orpheus Sonnets of Rilke) and incidental music for stage productions of <i>Othello</i> and <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream.</i>
