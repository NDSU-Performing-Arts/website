		<p>NDSU students take the stage; moving into place with a practiced precision - just the way they have done many times before. The house lights dim and the stage brightens. Suddenly, the students are transformed into seasoned performers and the thrill of the performance creates magic.</p>
		
		<p>This scenario is repeated time and again as NDSU Performing Arts brings music and theatre to life. As students perform, they learn, grow and constantly push their creativity.</p>
		
		<p>YOU make this magic happen. Because of the support of generations of donors, the NDSU Division of Performing Arts has a grand and storied history of presenting the finest in musical and theatrical performance. Please help us make this possible for years to come by becoming a Sustaining Member of the NDSU Division of Performing Arts.</p>
		
		<p>Sustaining members make a convenient, ongoing monthly contribution. It's an easy and efficient way for you to support NDSU Performing Arts through secure, automatic monthly payments from your credit or debit card.</p>
		
		<p>There's less mail, no renewal notices and you'll have uninterrupted status as a Sustaining Member. We'll simply deduct your designated contribution until you let us know to stop or change it.</p>
		
		<p>Please contribute to the NDSU Performing Arts Endowment Fund, which creates permanent funds that generate income in perpetuity or NDSU Performing Arts Fund, in which donations provide current funds that can be used for immediate needs.</p>
