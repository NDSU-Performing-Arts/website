		<p>Welcome!</p>

		<p>Our students at NDSU study theatre for many reasons.</p>
 
		<p>Those who wish to be theatre professionals pick one of our three Bachelor of Fine Arts programs in Performance, Musical Theatre, or Design/Technology.</p>
 
		<p>For students who want a more general theatre degree, we have strong Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees. These two degrees also work well for those who want to double-major or for students interested in theatre education, directing, or dramaturgy.</p>
 
		<p>Our department offers a production environment modeled on professional theatre but in an educational setting. We also have several student organizations including: USITT, newfangled theatre company, and TBD Comedy.</p>
