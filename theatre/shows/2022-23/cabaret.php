		<p>Wilkommen to Theatre NDSU for this cheeky, yet powerful award-winning musical set in 1920’s Berlin. In the Kit Kat Club life is beautiful and Sally Bowles is a star. When Sally meets Cliff, a young American writer, it seems life will become a cabaret—but instead, life becomes more complicated as Berlin transforms into a political ground for the Nazi Party.</p>
