			<p>Wilkommen to Theatre NDSU for this cheeky, yet powerful award-winning musical set in 1920’s Berlin. In the Kit Kat Club life is beautiful and Sally Bowles is a star. When Sally meets Cliff, a young American writer, it seems life will become a cabaret—but instead, life becomes more complicated as Berlin transforms into a political ground for the Nazi Party.</p>

				<p>June and Weezy live on a small farm in the backwoods of Alabaster, Alabama. They lost nearly everything to a horrific tornado that buried June alive. Now Alice, an artist, is visiting from New York City to take photographs of June’s scars. Weezy has a lot to say about this, but Alice cannot understand her. Why? Well, because Weezy is a goat, of course! Join Theatre NDSU for this quirky new dramedy about how we persevere in the face of grief.</p>

				  <p>April 20-22 & 27-29 at 7:30pm</p>
				  <p>Viola, separated from her twin brother in a shipwreck, washes ashore in an unknown land. To stay safe, Viola must disguise herself as a man and serve the Duke Orsino. Orsino is dreadfully lovesick and sends his new servant to win the heart of the beautiful Olivia. Viola wants to do what her new master has asked, but how can she when she realizes she is, in fact, in love with Orsino? Shakespeare’s classic comedy mixes love, and sometimes lust, with mistaken identities.</p>
