	    <p>The Velveteen Rabbit has one wish—to be real. But how? One night the toy fairy visits to give the Velveteen Rabbit her wish. The Velveteen Rabbit should be overjoyed, but she can’t. The boy who loves her is sick with scarlet fever and may die if she leaves with the toy fairy. What will she do? Margery Williams’ beloved tale is brought to life in this stage version for the whole family. Explore what it means to love and live without bounds. </p>
		
	    <p>Due to the restrictions for on campus instruction our theatre rehearsals will be cancelled for the two weeks following spring break. To accommodate this condensed schedule for rehearsals, our first weekend of performances for<em> the Velveteen Rabbit</em> have been cancelled. Our box office manager will be in contact with patrons who have already purchased tickets for the April 24 and 25th shows to make additional arrangements. </p></p>
