		<p>The scheming con man Tartuffe charms his way into Orgon’s household with plans to marry his daughter, seduce his wife, and run off with his fortune. Despite Tartuffe’s appalling behavior, Organ is blinded to the truth – will he see through Tartuffe’s pious mask before it’s too late? One of the world’s greatest plays, Molière’s hilarious farce takes an over-the-top twist in the style of commedia dell'arte that will resonate with contemporary audiences.</p>
