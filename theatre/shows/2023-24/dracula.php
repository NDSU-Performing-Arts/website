		<p>Dracula and his two vampire wives are out for blood in London. Dr. Seward calls for help from a renowned doctor named Van Helsing. When a woman in a cowboy hat answers the call, Seward is loath to believe that this “lady” has the power to defeat Dracula—but, as Van Helsing notes, she’s not a lady—she’s a doctor. It’s destroy or be destroyed in this new feminist adaptation of the haunted classic that is sure to scare and delight!</p>
