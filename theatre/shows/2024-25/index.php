				  <p>It’s 1983. Dallas is America’s favorite television program, “Every Breath You Take” by the Police is topping the Billboard charts, and Dr. Sally Ride is about to become the first woman in space. Join best friends Harriet & Matilda as they raise a few beers and listen to the space launch on the radio. It’s a historical night and these friends have history—so much history it’s difficult to know if Harriet & Matilda are just friends or would like to be something more.</p>

			  <p>This hysterical Victorian romp follows two friends, Algernon & Jack, who are both themselves and not. You see, both men, themselves in London, assume fictional identities in the country. What’s more, both men are in love with women who are set on marrying a man named Earnest. How will the men change their names? How will they win their love? How will they prove they are, in fact, earnest and Earnest? Join Theatre NDSU for this classic comedy of manners.</p>
