				    October 11-13 and 17-20 | 7:30pm | Walsh Studio Theatre</p>

					<p>Mary is in love with Crick. They might live happily ever after until Mary runs into her old high school friend Red, a lady cowboy who “always wore a money clip instead of wearing a purse”. Red exudes the air of freedom—something Mary didn’t even know she lacked, and is now desperate to find.</p>

					<p>It’s the heart of the 1980’s and it’s time to dance—at Athens High School’s senior prom, that is. Put on your leg warmers and sweatbands as Shakespeare’s beloved comedy takes a page from classic 80’s teen movies. This production is sure to be a wild, whimsical romp through the world of teased bangs for every generation.  </p>
