		<p>Theatre NDSU in collaboration with the NDSU Challey School of Music presents “Into the Woods” on February 27-29 at 7:30 p.m. and March 1 at 2:00 p.m. Performances are held in Festival Concert Hall in the Reineke Fine Arts building at North Dakota State University.</p>
 
		<p>When the Baker and the Baker’s Wife learn they cannot have a child because of a witch’s curse, they set out on a journey to break the spell. Along the way they meet Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Jack, and Rapunzel. James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim’s Tony Award-winning musical reimagines classic fairytales, and reveals a moral for all eras.</p>
