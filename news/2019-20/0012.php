	  	<p><b>Fargo, N.D. - </b>NDSU Director of Choral Activities, Dr. Jo Ann Miller participated as the guest conductor for the Minnesota All-State Mixed Choir. In addition to the Mixed Choir, there is also a Soprano/Alto choir conducted this year by Therees Hubbard of St. Olaf Collegen and a Tenor/Bass choir conducted this year by Michael Culloton of Concordia College.</p>

		<p>The Minnesota Music Educators Association All-State – considered one of the top programs of its kind across the nation – develops high school musicians and school music programs. The All-State program supports secondary school music ensembles, MMEA members and members’ students.</p>
	
		<p>Students attend camp in August where they meet their guest conductor and attend long hours of rehearsals and sectionals. Although the major focus during the summer camp is developing advanced technique and making music, a full schedule of recreation and social activities gives the students an opportunity to relax and develop new friendships. The August concert is the result of great dedication and commitment by some of the most talented young musicians in Minnesota. All of the young musicians meet again in February to perform at Orchestra Hall as part of the MMEA Midwinter Clinic.</p>
