	  	<p><b>Fargo, N.D. - </b>We remain concerned about the seriousness of the national Coronavirus health situation.  Performing Arts has a faculty and staff team that addresses ongoing issues daily, and is continually dealing with the changing situation.  Student and staff safety is of paramount importance.  Yet we still are committed to delivering high quality online continuing instruction in Music and Theatre.<br>
	  	</p>
	  	<p>NDSU announced on March 21 that online distance delivery will be the model for all instruction through the summer. To limit health risks on campus, the following policies are now in place for the Reineke Fine Arts Center, the Music Education Building, and Askanase Hall.  Conditions may change. We expect a return to in-person instruction, including most regular campus activities, starting with the fall 2020 semester.  </p>
  	<p>1. Events and activities:  All direct instruction, performances, and rehearsals in the buildings are suspended through the summer session.</p>
  	
  	 <p>2. Except for faculty and staff activities for maintenance and delivery of online instruction, the buildings are closed.  Further, absolutely no one with cold or flu symptoms is allowed in the buildings.</p>
	
	
	<p>3. Safety: Social distancing and sanitary procedures must be followed.</p>
  	<p>4.	Contact:  Students should contact their instructors regarding coursework and advising, and Performing Arts staff for other assistance.	</p>
  	<p>Watch this space for updates.  We’re all concerned about everyone’s health and safety.</p>
