			<h1> University Symphony Orchestra Information for Fall 2020</h1>
	  <p>The University Symphony Orchestra will not meet as a traditional orchestra for the fall semester of 2020.  However, as an alternative, we will be forming string quartets and quintets for those interested in performing in an ensemble.  This is an outstanding new opportunity that we hope you will consider as an option.  We hope to have the University Symphony Orchestra back in its traditional formulation in the spring semester of 2021.</p>
	  
	  <p>Those interested in being a part of the string chamber ensembles should send an email to <a href="mailto:nelsont2@fargo.k12.nd.us">Tim Nelson</a> indicating their interest.  Mr. Nelson will then contact everyone with more details in the early part of the semester.
