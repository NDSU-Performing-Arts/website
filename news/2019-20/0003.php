		<p><b>Fargo, N.D.</b> - NDSU Challey School of Music is proud to present the North Dakota premiere of Minnesota composer Joceyln Hagen’s concert piece, <em>The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci</em>, at Festival Concert Hall on Saturday, Oct. 19th at 7:30 PM. </p>
	  <p>Performed with the NDSU Concert Choir and orchestra, the work will be led by Director of Choral Activities Dr. Jo Ann Miller. Video projections featuring excerpts from the notebooks will be integrated into the musical performance using a new music/video synchronization technology created by Minneapolis-based Ion Concert Media, which will make its debut with these premieres.<br>

	  <p>Jocelyn Hagen composes music that has been described as “simply magical” (Fanfare Magazine) and “dramatic and deeply moving” (Star Tribune, Minneapolis/St. Paul). She is a pioneer in the field of composition, pushing the expectations of musicians and audiences with large-scale multimedia works, electro-acoustic music, dance, opera, and publishing. Her first forays into composition were via songwriting, still very evident in her work. The majority of her compositions are for the voice: solo, chamber and choral. Her melodic music is rhythmically driven and texturally complex, rich in color and deeply heartfelt.
