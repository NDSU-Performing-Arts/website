	  	<p><b>Fargo, N.D.</b> Fargo, N.D. – Theatre NDSU, the production company at North Dakota State University, presents “A Dream Play” on December 5-7 and December 11-14. Performances are at 7:30 p.m. in the Askanase Auditorium in Askanase Hall. </p>

		<p>A young woman named Agnes embarks on a journey to find the meaning of life—but this world is different. Everything can happen, everything is possible and probable. Time and place do not exist; the imagination spins, weaving new patterns on a flimsy basis of reality. Written in 1901, Strindberg’s A Dream Play weaves seamlessly through the dreamer’s imagination.</p>

		<p>Tickets for the show are $10 for students, $15 for seniors and $20 for adults. Tickets are available through the NDSU Box Office at (701) 231-7969 or online at ndsu.showare.com</p>
	
		<p>NDSU Students can get their FREE ticket by calling or visiting the Performing Arts Box Office.</p>
