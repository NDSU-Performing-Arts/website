	<h1>Learn more about live streaming with NDSU Performing Arts </h1>
	  <p>This semester we are taking measures to protect our students, faculty, staff, and guests while still providing valuable learning and performance opportunities. We will not have public audiences for any indoor concerts, except for supervising faculty members and technical staff. All performances in Beckwith Recital Hall and Festival Concert Hall will be recorded and livestreamed to the general public.
