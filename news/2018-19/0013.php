		<p><b>Fargo, N.D.</b>  In the Spring of 2019, the NDSU Wind Symphony will fly over 4,500 miles to Prague, Czech Republic to embark on a tour of Eastern Europe. This tour will feature performances across Eastern Europe including the MOM Culture Institute in Budapest, the Slovak Radio Hall in Bratislava, and the Spanish Hall in the Prague Castle.</p>
		
		<p>In the Fall of 2017 on campus, the NDSU Wind Symphony had the opportunity to work with Colonel VÃ¡clav Blahunek, conductor of the Prague Castle Guard and Czech Symphonic Police Band. It was through this experience, and the impression made upon Col. Blahunek, that the NDSU Wind Symphony received an invitation from The Ministry of Culture for the Czech Republic to perform with the Czech Police Symphonic Police Band in the Spanish Hall in the New Royal Palace of Prague Castle.</p>
		
		<p>The North Dakota State University Wind Symphony is the premier collegiate wind band performing group in the state of North Dakota. Students who participate experience the highest quality of music literature. Comprised of both Music Majors and Non-Majors, the members of the NDSU Wind Symphony come from a wide array of backgrounds and disciplines. Under the direction of Dr. Warren Olfert, students work tirelessly from practice room to the concert hall to create musical artistry for audiences across the Midwest and the Nation. Now they would like to bring that high level of excellence to the other side of the world.</p>
