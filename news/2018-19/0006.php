	  <p><b>Fargo, N.D. </b>North Dakota State University students from the Challey School of Music, recently competed and placed in the Minnesota National Association of Teachers of Singing (NATS) competition held at St. John‚Äôs University in Collegeville, Minnesota. Twenty-six music majors attended the prestigious student audition competition, of the twenty-six, eight were awarded as semi-finalists, and three as finalists in their division. Student awards included two first place, and one third place awards. Four NDSU student pianists accompanied the auditions including Caleb Lawson, Hong Liang Andre Ng, Hannah Swanson, and Xiang Wei.</p>

	<p>The mission of NATS is to ‚Äúencourage the highest standards of the vocal art and of ethical principles in the teaching of singing; and to promote vocal education and research at all levels, both for the enrichment of the general public and for the professional advancement of the talented‚Äù.</p>

	<p>Voice professors Dr. Mariane Lemieux and Dr. Robert Jones accompanied the students for the competition. Dr. Lemieux commented on the experience, ‚ÄúThis kind of events brings the best out of our students. They prepare through our weekly performance class which gives them confidence when they perform in a competitive setting. Every singer gets comments from the judges which helps them to identify their strengths and weaknesses and helps them improve. The auditions are public so they also learn a tremendous amount by listening to all the talented singers from Minnesota colleges. It was very rewarding and affirming for all of us to have so many students advance and win awards.‚Äù</p>

<p>Additionally, many of the semi-finalists have lead roles in NDSU‚Äôs upcoming production of Gilbert & Sullivan‚Äôs comic opera Patience. It will be presented in Festival Concert Hall on February 15 and 17, 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Below is a Q&amp;A with two of our winners, Elijah O‚ÄôSullivan, tenor, junior in music education, and Tessa Hartl, soprano, senior in vocal performance.</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>Why was it a positive experience?</strong>
  <br>
  <b>EO:</b> NATS was a positive experience because it brings out a healthy desire to perform at a high level against other talented singers.<br>
<b>TH:</b> Any opportunity to learn about how to improve my voice is a positive experience;  placing is only a bonus. <br>
 
<p><b>What did you enjoy the most?</b><br>
<b>EO:</b> I most enjoyed that some of my family was able to come and see me perform, fargo is too long of a trip for my great grandmother, and St. John's is just right for her. <br>
	<b>TH:</b> I enjoyed performing the most, a true albeit predictable answer. I feel most at home on stage,  and as an introvert,  connecting with an audience through music is how I feel I best communicate with other people (talk to me off-stage,  and you'll quickly  discover my verbal incontinence). I happen to have a stellar teammate,  pianist extraordinaire Hannah Swanson,  and she always makes performing a delight.</p>
 
<p><b>What was the greatest challenge?</b><br>
<b>EO:</b> I think the greatest challenge that I face and I think others do is to not let the outcome or result of NATS define your talent as a musician, some of the greatest musicians I know have never placed at this competition.<br>
	<b>TH:</b>The greatest challenge was remembering to breathe,  despite my stage fright trying to suffocate me. I learned that breathing becomes a voluntary function in the face of stage fright. </p>
 
<p><b>What did you learn?</b><br>
<b>EO:</b> I learned, as I usually do every year, is that I'll always have something that I can improve upon, regardless of outcome, but I am very grateful and honored to have  received 1st place honors. Go Bison ü§ü <br>
<b>TH:</b> Honestly, I learned that I'd been working too hard when I sing,  and that I can relax and trust that my voice will grow to be powerful in time. </p>
