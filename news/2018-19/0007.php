<p>Mack has also been inducted into the Hall of Fame at Bismarck St. Mary’s Central High School where he attended high school from 1974-1977. Mack received his undergraduate degree in instrumental and vocal music from Dickinson State University in 1981; he later was inducted as a “Distinguished Alumni Fellow” in 2009. Earlier in 2018, Mack received the National Band Association (NBA) ND Outstanding Jazz Educator Award and became a member of the NDSU Quarter Century Club for his 25 years of service.  He lives in south Fargo with his wife Sam, daughter Lauryn, and Baron von FitzWalter (a.k.a. Walter the cat).</p>
