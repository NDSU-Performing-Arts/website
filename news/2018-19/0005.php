<p>The Madrigal Dinners provide a rollicking atmosphere of Renaissance dining and entertainment, with holiday music by the Madrigal Singers and NDSU Brass Quintet ensembles. Hosted in the Challey Atrium of the NDSU Reineke Fine Arts Center, the dinner consists of several courses with a main entrée of beef, chicken or vegetarian fare. Following the meal, the Madrigal Singers will present a short concert of Christmas carols and music of the season. </p>
