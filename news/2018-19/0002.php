	  <p><b>Fargo, N.D. </b>Theatre NDSU, the production company at North Dakota State University, presents “Late, A Cowboy Song” by Sarah Ruhl, on October 11-13th, and October 17-20th. Performances are at 7:30 p.m. in the Walsh Studio Theatre in Askanase Hall. 

<p>Mary is in love with Crick. They might live happily ever after until Mary runs into her old high school friend Red, a lady cowboy who “always wore a money clip instead of wearing a purse”. Red exudes the air of freedom—something Mary didn’t even know she lacked, and is now desperate to find.</p>

<p>Tickets for the show are $8 for students/children, $12 for seniors and $15 for adults. Tickets are available through the NDSU Box Office at (701) 231-7969 or online at ndsu.showare.com</p>

<p>Performance Location: Walsh Studio Theatre is located in Askanase Hall, at the corner of 12th Avenue North and Albrecht Blvd.</p>
