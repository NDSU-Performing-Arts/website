	  <p><b>Fargo, N.D. </b>Theatre NDSU, the production company at North Dakota State University, presents “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” by William Shakespeare, on November 29 – December 1st, and December 5th-8th. Performances are at 7:30 p.m. in the Askanase Auditorium in Askanase Hall. </p>

		<p>It’s the heart of the 1980’s and it’s time to dance—at Athens High School’s senior prom, that is. Put on your leg warmers and sweatbands as Shakespeare’s beloved comedy takes a page from classic 80’s teen movies. This production is sure to be a wild, whimsical romp through the world of teased bangs for every generation.</p/>
