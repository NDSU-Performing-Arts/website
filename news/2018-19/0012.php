		<p><b>Fargo, N.D.</b>  Theatre NDSU, the production company at North Dakota State University, presents “Liminal: A Folktale” devised by the ensemble and directed by Marc Devine, Assistant Professor of Movement, on February 14-16th, and February 20-23rd. Performances are at 7:30 p.m. in the Walsh Studio Theatre in Askanase Hall. </p>

		<p>This performance re-imagines the heroine’s journey from the fairytale, <i>East of the Sun and West of the Moon</i>. Rose forms a kinship with a White Bear, only to discover he is a cursed prince who is a bear by day and a prince by night. Upon learning his identity, the prince is banished to a remote castle. Rose sets off on a journey to rescue to the prince, and in the process must free the cardinal winds: East, West, South and North. </p>

		<p>A performance for mature audiences, this thought-provoking theatre experience weaves together movement, abstract story-telling, and themes of feminism and human existence. This visually engaging new work mixes multi-media, folksong, fairytale, dance, and theatre to inventively tell the story of LIMINAL: a (re-imagined) folktale.</p>
