					Urinetown: The Musical
				</a>
			</strong><br>
			
			Music &amp; Lyrics by Mark Hollmann<br>
			Book &amp; Lyrics by Greg Kotis<br>
			Oct. 19–21 and Oct. 25–28, 2017 | 7:30 PM | Askanase Auditorium
		</p>
       
		<p>Get ready for a sidesplitting sendup of greed, love, revolution (and musicals!), in a time when water is worth its weight in gold. Winner of three Tony Awards, three Outer Critics Circle Awards, two Lucille Lortel Awards and two Obie Awards, <em>Urinetown</em> is a hilarious musical satire of the legal system, capitalism, social irresponsibility, populism, bureaucracy, corporate mismanagement, municipal politics and musical theatre itself! Hilariously funny and touchingly honest, Urinetown provides a fresh perspective on one of America's greatest art forms.</p>

		<p>The scheming con man Tartuffe charms his way into Orgon’s household with plans to marry his daughter, seduce his wife, and run off with his fortune. Despite Tartuffe’s appalling behavior, Organ is blinded to the truth – will he see through Tartuffe’s pious mask before it’s too late? One of the world’s greatest plays, Molière’s hilarious farce takes an over-the-top twist in the style of commedia dell’arte that will resonate with contemporary audiences.</p>
