		<p>Congratulations to NDSU Alum, <a href="http://www.claraosowski.com/">Clara Osowski</a>, recent recipient of <a href="https://www.macphail.org/mcknight-fellowships/">the McKnight Fellowship for Musicians</a> award. The winners are selected through a process that began in January when 79 solo and ensemble musicians applied for the McKnight Fellowship with recordings, artist statements and resumes. From this group, nine finalists were selected by a panel of national judges to audition live on May 4. Following the audition, four recipients were awarded the $25,000 McKnight Fellowship for Musicians. </p>

		<p>The McKnight Foundation, a Minnesota-based family foundation, seeks to improve the quality of life for present and future generations. The McKnight Foundationâ€™s arts program is one of the oldest and largest of its kind in the country. </p>
