		<p>Theatre NDSU, the production company at North Dakota State University, presents “Tartuffe” on February 22nd – 24th, February 28th, and March 1st -3rd. Performances are at 7:30 p.m. in the Walsh Studio Theatre in Askanase Hall.</p>

		<p>Early 20th century American circus meets commedia dell’arte movement techniques in this reimagining of Moliere’s classic. The scheming con man Tartuffe charms his way into Orgon’s household with plans to marry his daughter, seduce his wife, and run off with his fortune. Despite Tartuffe’s appalling behavior, Orgon is blinded to the truth – will he see through Tartuffe’s pious mask before it’s too late? One of the world’s greatest plays, Molière’s hilarious farce takes an over-the-top twist that will include masks, a slap-stick, and polka dot tights.</p>

		<p>Tickets for the show are $8 for students/children, $12 for seniors and $15 for adults. Tickets are available through the NDSU Box Office at (701) 231-7969 or online at
