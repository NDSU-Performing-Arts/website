		<p>A native of Valley City, ND, Jocelyn Hagen composes music that has been described as “simply magical” (Fanfare Magazine) and “dramatic and deeply moving” (Star Tribune, Minneapolis/St. Paul). Her first forays into composition were via songwriting, and this is very evident in her work. The majority of her compositional output is for the voice: solo, chamber and choral. In 2015,<i> Test Pilot</i>, her dance opera collaboration with choreographer Penelope Freeh, received a Sage Award for “Outstanding Design,” and the panel declared the work “a tour de force of originality.” She now resides in Minneapolis, and her work has been performed all over the world, including Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York City.</p>
	
		<p>Hagen is a two-time winner of prestigious McKnight Artist Fellowships in 2010 and 2014.  She has also received grants and awards from ASCAP, the American Composers Forum, Minnesota Music Educators Association, the Jerome Foundation, VocalEssence, the Young New Yorkers Chorus, the Yale Glee Club, the Lotte Lehman Foundation, the Sorel Medallion Competition, the Cincinnati Camerata, the University of Minnesota, and the San Francisco Song Festival.</p>

		<p>Her commissions include Conspirare, The Minnesota Orchestra, the American Choral Directors Associations of Minnesota, Georgia, Connecticut and Texas, the North Dakota Music Teacher’s Association, Cantus, the Boston Brass, and the ensembles at North Dakota State University, to name a few. Her work is independently published through JH Music, Graphite Publishing, G. Schirmer, Santa Barbara Music Publishing, Fred Bock Music Publishing, and Boosey and Hawkes.</p>
