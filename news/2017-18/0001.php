		<p><em>Fargo, N.D.</em> - Mezzo-soprano Clara Osowski (NDSU Bachelor of Music 2008) accompanied by Dr. Tyler Wottrich, assistant professor of piano, Challey School of Music, took fourth place in the 2017 Wigmore Hall/Kohn Foundation International Song Competition. The only female vocalist in the finals, she was awarded the Richard Tauber Prize for best performance of Schubert Lieder. Held at Wigmore Hall in London on September 2-7, the competition featured 23 selected duos from 15 countries.</p>

		<p>In March, Ms. Oswoski was awarded the 2nd prize award in the prestigious 2017 Das Lied International Song Competition, where she was also accompanied by Dr. Wottrich. Following the Wigmore Hall event, the duo were invited to perform on Sept. 8 on the prestigious BBC radio program “In Tune.”</p>

		<p>Ms. Osowski is an award-winning soloist and chamber musician who performs throughout the United States and Europe. Earlier in 2017, she won the Saengerbund Awards German Vocal Competition in Houston, and previously was a finalist in the 2015 Das Lied competition.
