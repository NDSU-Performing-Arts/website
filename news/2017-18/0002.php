		<p><em>Fargo, N.D.</em> - NDSU Performing Arts and the Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra are partnering on a benefit concert for hurricane relief on Sunday, Sept. 17 at 2:00 p.m. at Festival Concert Hall, NDSU Reineke Fine Arts Center. The concert is free and open to the public, and free-will donations will be accepted for the American Red Cross â€“ Dakotas Region. All event expenses will be donated, so 100 percent of audience donations received during the concert will go directly to Red Cross Disaster Relief to help those affected by 2017 hurricanes in the United States, such as Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma.</p>
 
		<p>The concert will include performances by the FM Symphony Brass Quintet, the NDSU BisonArts Singers with the Radio All Stars, Symphony violinist and Houston native Sonja Harasim, and other musicians with the Symphony and the NDSU Challey School of Music. American Red Cross Regional CEO Lynn Speral and NDSU President Dean Bresciani will also take the stage during the show.</p>
 
		<p>Financial donations enable the American Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from disasters, such as Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. This includes providing food, shelter, relief supplies, emotional support, recovery planning and other assistance, to those affected by these devastating storms.</p>
