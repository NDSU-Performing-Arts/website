		<p>The NDSU Challey School of Music will present its popular series of Madrigal Dinners on Dec. 7-9 on campus, and two holiday concerts of Handel’s Messiah on Dec. 1 and 2 at First Lutheran Church in Fargo.</p>
		
		<p>The Madrigal Dinners provide a rollicking atmosphere of Renaissance dining and entertainment, with holiday music by the Madrigal Singers and NDSU Brass Quintet ensembles. Hosted in the Challey Atrium of the NDSU Reineke Fine Arts Center, the dinner consists of several courses with a main entrée of beef, chicken or vegetarian fare. The dinners are offered Thursday-Saturday, Dec. 7-9, beginning at 6 p.m. Tickets for the Madrigal Dinners are $40 and the reservation deadline is Dec. 1. A special rate of $10 for NDSU students is available on Dec. 7.</p>
		
		<p>Conducted by Dr. Jo Ann Miller, more than 200 students in five choirs and the Baroque Festival Orchestra will present Handel’s Messiah, on Friday, Dec. 1 and Saturday, Dec. 2 at First Lutheran Church, 619 Broadway, Fargo. Both concerts are at 7:30 p.m. A holiday tradition throughout the world, Messiah combines Old and New Testament texts in one of the most memorable works of Western music, including the iconic Hallelujah Chorus. Tickets for the Messiah concert purchased in advance are $17 for adults, $12 for seniors, $7 for students (free to NDSU students with I.D.) and at the door are $20 for adults, $15 for seniors, and $10 for students.</p>
