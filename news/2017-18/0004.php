		<p>Fargo, N.D. - The NDSU Wind Symphony, under the direction of Dr. Warren Olfert, will present its 2017 Fall Tour in October, featuring works from composers that include David Maslanka, Eric Whitacre, Jack Stamp, Vincent Persichetti and Steven Bryant. NDSUâ€™s professor of horn, Gwendolyn Hoberg, will also perform with the ensemble.</p>
		
		<p>The Wind Symphony will perform a public concert at Mandan High School with the Mandan High School Wind Ensemble on Oct. 24 at 7:30 p.m. The 55-member ensemble will also visit other North Dakota high schools in the communities of Beulah, Bottineau, Grand Forks, Jamestown, Minot and Williston.</p>
		
		<p>The NDSU Wind Symphony is part of a tradition of band excellence at North Dakota State University that spans more than 100 years. Included in that tradition is a legacy of performances around the nation through tours and conferences and the contribution of new music to the band world through commissions and consortiums. The Wind Symphony has worked with composers such as David Maslanka and Dana Wilson and has performed with internationally renowned soloists Eugene Rousseau and Los Angeles Philharmonic Principal Trumpet Thomas Hooten.</p>
