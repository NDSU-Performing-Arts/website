	<p>“Chamber music is special in that these mighty composers have created personal works that implicate performer and listener alike as the music unfolds—at times moving, at times exciting or even humorous,” said Tyler Wottrich, festival artistic director and assistant professor of piano at NDSU. “We invite you to join us in the NDSU Chamber Music Festival's fourth season as NDSU student pianists work with professional string players to bring this incredible music to life.”</p>
	
	<p>Student pianists are invited to attend open rehearsals and social events with NDSU pianists and guest artists by contacting Tyler Wottrich at tyler.wottrich@ndsu.edu.
